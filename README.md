# VstheWorld
This is a solution to help with the "The Pole Mine: Vs the World" achievement in The Jackbox Party Pack 8.

This achievement requires the player to win a game of The Pole Mine in streamer mode with an audience of at least 1000. This application opens 1000 headless Chrome browser instances and logs into the game corresponding to the room code provided when running the script.

# Installation
